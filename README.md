# Chaos_Music_Generator_OneTrack

Generates a stream of midi notes based on the Lorenz Attractor equation and sends them to a DAW through a midibus(es).

This app was written in MIT's Processing programming language. It was originally developed to generate music for the film, â€œWeather and Chaos: The Work of Edward N. Lorenz", which you can view at: https://vimeo.com/287523707.

You can learn more about how the music was created here: https://robjaret.com/soundtrack-to-chaos/

and listen to the full soundtrack here: https://robjaret.bandcamp.com/album/weather-and-chaos-the-work-of-edward-lorenz

The app needs to be configured in the code at these places:
- Setup initialization of attractor ~line 15
- Setup names of midi busses to your DAW's input
- Adjust the range of notes generated ~line 128
- Setup constant note duration and velocity ~line 70
  
Feel free to reach out with any questions!
